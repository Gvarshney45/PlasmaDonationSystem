            <h2>‚ñ™Ô∏è IS IT SAFE TO DONATE PLASMA?</h2>
            Blood and plasma have been used to treat many other conditions, and
            they‚Äôre usually very safe. The risk of contracting COVID-19
            infection from receiving convalescent plasma therapy is very low
            because the plasma donor has fully recovered from the infection.
            <br />
            <h2>‚ñ™Ô∏è WHAT IS ANTIBODY TEST?</h2>
            An antibody test is a screening for antibodies in blood. It is also
            called a serology test.The antibody test isn‚Äôt checking for the
            virus itself. Instead, it looks to see whether your immune system ‚Äî
            your body‚Äôs defense against illness ‚Äî has responded to the
            infection.
            <br />
            <h3>
              ‚ñ™Ô∏è WHAT‚ÄôS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CORONAVIRUS TEST AND AN
              ANTIBODY TEST?
            </h3>
            A coronavirus test, sometimes called a diagnostic test, looks for
            signs of active virus. It‚Äôs simpler and faster than an antibody
            test. But it tells you only if you have the virus in your body at
            the moment when you‚Äôre tested.An antibody test shows that you had
            the virus at some point in the past. It could be gone, or you could
            still be contagious.
            <h3>
              ‚ñ™Ô∏è HOW MANY DAYS A RECOVERED BODY CAN TAKE TO DEVELOP ANTIBODY
            </h3>
            Antibodies develops in 14 to 28 days, and it will last till 2-3
            months.

            <b>‚ñ™Ô∏è WHAT IS (RT-PCR) TEST:</b>
            <br />
            Reverse transcription PCR, or RT-PCR is a variation of PCR, or
            polymerase chain reaction.
